Hello everyone, my name is Shawn Zachariah. I am a 4th year undergrad in
Electrical Engineering. I studied my first two years of undergrad at my local
college, Oakton Community College. I transferred in to Illinois Tech last fall.

I spend most of time working with my NASA Robotic Mining team on campus. I also
live in MSV so if anyone wants to chat, get food, or even study, I am always
open to that. I'm looking forward to having a productive semester!
