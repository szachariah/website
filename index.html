    I am a junior undergraduate pursuing my B.S in Electrical Engineering at
    Illinois Institute of Technology(Illinois Tech) in Chicago, IL. My interests
    lie within Radar Applications and Power Conversion Technology. Over the
    years, these areas are increasingly getting complex, resulting in demands
    for advanced research. My hopes are, through my work experience, I will
    someday be able to provide solutions for these exciting new challenges.

    My aspirations is to someday work for a Defense contractor. I am interested
    in working with the Department of Defense and assist in designing and
    manufacturing the world's next cutting-edge advanced technology for our
    military. The summer of 2016, I was able to intern for one of the most
    innovative Defense contractors within the Aerospace Industry, called
    Northrop Grumman Corporation. Being a Hardware Engineering Intern, my
    projects included working with Test Design Engineers and being able to test
    and debug power supplies geared towards space programs in a Production Test
    Facility. In space programs, I was able to gain experience working under the
    strict regulations and protocols testing production space hardware.

    At my university, I am heavily involved with my robotics team, Scarlet Space
    Hawks. I am the Founder and President of my student organization at Illinois
    Tech. We compete in the annually held NASA Robotic Mining Competition at the
    NASA Kennedy Space Center located in Cape Canaveral, FL. NASA's mission is
    to allow college students to find innovative mining techniques to obtain the
    water-ice found under the surface of Mars. This in turn will someday allow
    humans to "live off the land" or in scientific terms "In Situ Resource
    Utilization (ISRU)". My team's objective every year is to build a martian
    rover from scratch, find new innovative mining techniques, and also develop
    software to make our robot navigate and dig autonomously. Last year, being a
    first-year organization, we were able to secure third place in Mining
    beating out forty-nine other universities which include some top tier
    schools such University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Purdue University,
    University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, New York University, etc. Other than my
    administrative roles of overseeing the organization, I worked within the
    Electrical Team where I was able to assist in designing the power systems of
    the robot.

    In addition to my robotics team, I also worked last year within a Start-Up
    based out of Chicago called, BasicBlox. I worked within a team of ten
    Engineers where we were innovating a patent-pending solar powered charger. I
    worked as a Test Engineer where my role was to test and debug the Battery
    Management System(BMS). My work also consisted of developing code and use
    the Arduino micro-controller to automate all the testing for our BMS. This
    year, I am working under Dr. Mahesh Krishnamurthy, Associate Professor of
    Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am working as a Undergraduate
    Researcher working on developing a wireless Electric Vehicle(EV) charger. My
    focus from this experience is to be able gain experience in designing
    hardware, run simulations, and manufacture a charger to sell to companies.
