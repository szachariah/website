  <h1>Shawn Zachariah</h1>
  <p>
    Hello everyone, my name is Shawn Zachariah. I am a 4th year undergrad in
    Electrical Engineering. I studied my first two years of undergrad at my
    local college, Oakton Community College. I transferred in to Illinois Tech
    last  fall.

    I spend most of time working with my NASA Robotic Mining team on campus. I
    also live in MSV so if anyone wants to chat, get food, or even study, I am
    always open to that. I'm looking forward to having a productive semester!
  </p>
